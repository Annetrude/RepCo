# Introduction
THIS IS NOT MY DATA!

In this project, we explore the `Zoo` dataset from the `mlbench` package. 
It contains 101 animals and their traits, like whether they have feathers, lay eggs, or are predators. 
Each animal is also labeled by class (e.g., mammal, bird, fish).

I have use this dataset to practice:

- Loading and inspecting data
- Cleaning variable names
- Creating plots to explore traits
- Summarizing animal classes

# Installation
For your convenience, there is an R LOCK file stored in the folder "R"

Prerequisites: 
* RStudio
* library(tidyverse)
* library(mlbench)

# How to run the program
The main script is located in folder "R" and named "Animal_traits".
The neccesary packages are included in the code. 
All the data is already embedded in the mlbench package, so once this has been installed you're good 
to go.

# Results
The resulting heatmap image of will be saved in the "results" folder as a pdf.
